**Development Status: Pre-Alpha**

Misago aims to be complete, featured and modern forum solution that has no fear to say 'NO' to common and outdated opinions about how forum software should be made and what it should do.

If you can run Python apps on your hosting and you are looking for modern solution using latest paradigms in web development, or you are Django developer and forum is going to be core component of your next project then Misago is option for you.

Don't use this branch in production!
====================================

This branch contains in-development code of next major Misago release, 0.6. If you are looking at running "real" forum on Misago, please use latest 0.5 release instead.

**There is no update path for 0.6 installations!**


Development
===========


To start Misago site locally, first setup and activate virtual environment for it and then fire following commands::

    python setup.py install
    misago-start.py testforum

This will install Misago in your virtual environment and will make pre-configured Misago site for you named "testforum". It will also expose "requirements.txt" for you to use to install Misago dependencies::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Now cd to "testforum" and edit "settings.py" file in your editor of choice in order to set up basic settings like database connection, default timezone or interface language.

Next, initialize database by using migrate commands provided by manage.py admin utility::

    cd testforum
    python manage.py migrate

Then, call "createsuperuser" command to create super admin in database::

    python manage.py createsuperuser

Finally start development server using "runserver" command::

    python manage.py runserver


If nothing is wrong with your setup, Django developer server will start, enabling you to visit 127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser and see the (incomplete) forum index.


Frontend
--------

With exception of Admin Panel, Misago frontend is powered by Ember.js application backed by Django API. This application relies on Ember-CLI toolkit for development.

To learn more about it please see README file located in emberapp directory.
