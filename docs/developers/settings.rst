Accessing Settings
==================

Misago splits its settings into two groups:

* **Low level settings** - those settings must be available when Misago starts or control resources usage and shouldn't be changed frequently from admin control panel. Those settings live in ``settings.py``
* **High level settings** - those settings are stored in database and can be changed on runtime using interface provided by admin control panel.

Both types of settings can accessed as attributes of ``misago.conf.settings`` object and high level settings can be also accessed from your templates as attributes of ``misago_settings`` context value.

.. note::
   Not all high level settings values are available at all times. Some settings ("lazy settings"), are evaluated to ``True`` or ``None`` immediately upon load. This means that they can be checked to see if they have value or not, but require you to use special ``get_lazy_setting(setting)`` getter to obtain their real value.


Defining Custom DB Settings
===========================

.. note::
   Current Misago 0.6 migrations are south-based placeholders that will be replaced with new migrations introduced in Django 1.7 before release. For this reason this instruction focuses exclusively on usage of utility function provided by Misago.

In order to define or change high-level (stored in database) settings you have to add new rows to ``conf_settingsgroup`` and ``conf_settings`` database tables. This can be done by plenty of different ways, but preffered one is by creating new data migration and using functions from ``misago.conf.migrationutils`` module.


migrate_settings_group
----------------------

.. function:: migrate_settings_group(orm, group_fixture, old_group_key=None)

This function uses south supplied ORM instance to insert/update settings group in database according to provided dict contianing its name, description and contained settings. If new group should replace old one, you can provide its key in ``old_group_key`` argument.

The ``group_fixture`` dict should define following keys:

* **key** - string with settings group key.
* **name** - string with settings group name.
* **description** - optional string with short settings group description.
* **settings** - tuple containing dics describing settings belonging to this group.

Each dict in ``settings`` tuple should define following keys:

* **setting** - string with internal setting name.
* **name** - string with displayed setting name.
* **description** - optional string with small setting help message.
* **legend** - optional string indicating that before displaying this setting in form, new fieldset should be opened and this value should be used in its legend element.
* **python_type** - optional string defining type of setting's value. Can be either "string", "int", "bool" or "list". If omitted "string" is used by default.
* **value** - list, integer or string with default value for this setting.
* **default_value** - if your setting should always have value, specify there fallabck value used if no user-defined value is available.
* **is_public** - public settings are included JSON that is passed to Ember.js application. Defaults to ``False``.
* **is_lazy** - if setting value may too large to be always loaded into memory, you may make setting lazily loaded by defining this key with ``True`` value assigned.
* **form_field** - What form field should be used to change this setting. Can be either "text", "textarea", "select", "radio", "yesno" or "checkbox". If not defined, "text" is used. "checkbox" should be used exclusively for multiple choices list.
* **field_extra** - dict that defines extra attributes of form field. For "select", "radio" and "checkbox" fields this dict should contain "choices" key with tuple of tuples that will be used for choices in input. For "string" settings you can define "min_length" and "max_length" extra specifying minmal and maximal lenght of entered text. For integer settings you can specify minimal and maximal range in which value should fall by "min_value" and "max_value". "textarea" field supports extra "rows" setting that controls generated textarea rows attribute. All text-based fields accept "required" setting. "checkbox" field supports "min" and "max" values that control minimum and maximum required choices.


.. note::
   If you wish to make your names and messages translateable, you should use ``ugettext_lazy`` function provided by Misago instead of Django one. This function is defined in ``misago.core.migrationutils`` module and differs from Django one by the fact that it preserves untranslated message on its ``message`` attribute.

   For your convience ``migrate_settings_group`` triess to switch translation messages with their "message" attribute when it writes to database and thus making their translation to new languages in future possible.


with_conf_models
----------------

.. function:: with_conf_models(migration, this_migration=None)

South migrations define special ``models`` attribute that holds dict representing structure of database at time of migration execution. This dict will by default contain only your apps models. To add settings models that ``migrate_settings_group`` requires to work, you have to use ``with_conf_models`` function. This function accepts two arguments:

* **migration** - name of migration in ``misago.conf`` app containing models definitions current for the time of your data migration.
* **this_migration** - dict with model definitions for this migration.

In addition to this, make sure that your migration ``depends_on`` attribute defines dependency on migration from ``misago.conf`` app::

    class Migration(DataMigration):

        # Migration code...

        models = with_conf_models('0001_initial', {
            # This migration models
        })

        depends_on = (
            ("conf", "0001_initial"),
        )


delete_settings_cache
---------------------

.. function:: delete_settings_cache()

If you have used ``migrate_settings_group`` function in your migration, make sure to call ``delete_settings_cache`` at its end to flush settings caches.
